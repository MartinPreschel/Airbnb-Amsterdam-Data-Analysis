# Airbnb Amsterdam Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes **Airbnb listings in Amsterdam** to uncover pricing patterns, host behaviors, booking trends, and neighborhood dynamics. The insights derived from this analysis aim to support data-driven decisions for hosts, travelers, and policymakers.

### Key Questions:
- **Which neighborhoods have the highest average nightly prices?**
- **How does room type affect the price of a listing?**
- **Do Superhosts charge more than regular hosts?**
- **What types of listings receive the most reviews per month?**
- **Can we group similar listings into distinct clusters?**
- **Is it possible to predict nightly prices based on listing features?**
- **How has availability changed over time across neighborhoods?**

## Dataset Information
The following datasets are used in this analysis:
- **listings.csv.gz** â€“ Airbnb listing data including prices, reviews, location, host type, etc.  
  Source: [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
- **neighbourhoods.geojson** â€“ GeoJSON file of Amsterdam neighborhoods  
  Source: [Data Amsterdam](https://data.amsterdam.nl/)
- **neighbourhoods.csv** â€“ Custom file to map listing neighborhood names to the GeoJSON labels
- **Time series data** â€“ External data sourced via Quandl for availability trend analysis

## Tools & Technologies Used
This analysis was conducted using **Python** and the following key libraries:
- **Pandas** â€“ Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** â€“ Numerical computations
- **Seaborn** & **Matplotlib** â€“ Data visualization
- **GeoPandas** & **Folium** â€“ Geospatial data analysis and mapping
- **Scikit-learn** â€“ Predictive modeling and clustering
- **Statsmodels** â€“ Time series decomposition and stationarity testing

## Programming Languages
- **Python** (Jupyter Notebooks for the analysis)
